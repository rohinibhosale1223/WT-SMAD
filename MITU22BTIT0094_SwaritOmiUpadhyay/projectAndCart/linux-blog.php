        <h2>Linux</h2>
        <p>Linux is a family of open-source operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. It is characterized by its customizability and the support of a wide range of hardware and software.</p>
        <p>One of the key features of Linux is its open-source nature, which allows anyone to view, modify, and distribute the source code. This has led to the development of a large and active community of developers and users who contribute to the ongoing improvement and evolution of the operating system.</p>
        <p>Linux distributions, or "distros," are variants of Linux that package together the Linux kernel with a collection of software and utilities to provide a complete operating system experience. Some popular Linux distros include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and CentOS.</p>
        <p>Linux is widely used in a variety of contexts, including desktop computers, servers, embedded systems, and supercomputers. It powers many of the world's largest websites and services, including Google, Facebook, and Amazon.</p>
        <p>For developers, Linux provides a powerful and flexible platform for building software and applications. It includes a rich set of development tools and programming languages, as well as support for containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, Linux is a versatile and robust operating system that offers unparalleled flexibility, security, and performance. With its open-source nature and thriving community, it continues to be a popular choice for both individuals and organizations seeking a reliable and customizable computing solution.</p>
